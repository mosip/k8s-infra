# Ingress-nginx
## Introduction
* Ingress NGINX is a popular and widely used Ingress controller for Kubernetes, built around the open-source NGINX web server.
* Itâ€™s designed to handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic to your applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster, providing features like load balancing, SSL termination, and URL path-based routing.
* It is built around the Kubernetes Ingress resource, using a ConfigMap to store the controller configuration.
## Setup ingress-nginx in k8 cluster
* Depending upon the ways of exposing the services to external traffic, ingress nginx can be deployed in multiple ways.
* Most common methods are using `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer` service types.
* Each method has its own use case suitable for different environment on-premisis or cloud based k8 clusters.
  * Expose as NodePort: 
    * NodePort exposes the NGINX Ingress controller on a specific port on each node of k8 cluster.
    * External traffic can be directed to any node's IP address, along with the NodePort, to reach the Ingress controller.
    * Suitable for on-premises or bare-metal Kubernetes clusters nothaving loadbalancers.
  * Expose as LoadBalancer:
    * LoadBalancer is typically used in cloud environments (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
    * It automatically provisions an external load balancer, which forwards traffic to the NGINX Ingress controller.
    * Simplifies SSL management and DNS configuration.
    * Fully integrates with cloud provider features, such as auto-scaling and health checks.
    * Automatically provides a single external IP address or DNS name for the Ingress.
### Deploy as NodePort
* Add helm repo and update the same:
  ```
  helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
  helm repo update
  ```
* Helm install ingress-nginx
  ```
  helm install \                                                                                                             
    ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-nginx \
    --version 4.0.18 \
    --create-namespace  \
    -f ingress-nginx-np.values.yaml
  ```
* Ingress Nginx should be installed. Check the same:
  ```
  kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx
  ```
### Deploy as Loadbalancer NLB in AWS
* Add helm repo and update the same:
  ```
  helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
  helm repo update
  ```
* Helm install ingress-nginx
  ```
  helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
  helm repo update
  helm install \                               
    ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-nginx \
    --create-namespace  \
  -f ingress-nginx-lb.values.yaml
  ```
* The above will automatically spawn an [Internal AWS Network Load Balancer (L4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-network-load-balancer.html).
* Check the following on AWS console:
  * An NLB has been created. You may also see the DNS of NLB with
    ```
    kubectl -n ingress-nginx get svc
    ```
  * Obtain AWS TLS certificate from Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) as given [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html).
  * Edit listner "443". Select "TLS".
    * Check the target group name of listner 80.
    * Set target group of 443 to target group of 80.
    * Basically, we want TLS termination at the LB and it must forward HTTP traffic (not HTTPS) to port 80 of ingress controller. So:
      * Input of LB: HTTPS.
      * Output of LB: HTTP --> port 80 of ingress nginx controller.
  * Enable "Proxy Protocol v2" in the target group settings.
  * Make sure all subnets are selected in LB -->Description-->Edit subnets.
  * Check health check of target groups.
  * Remove listner 80 from LB as we will receive traffic only on 443.
