# On-prem Kubernetes Cluster using RKE
## Prerequisites for Client machines
* For setting up RKE cluster need the deployer system to have below mentioned packages.
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
* rke: RKE binary for version [v1.5.7](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.5.7) is configured.
## Prepare the nodes for K8 cluster creation
* The Kubernetes cluster components are launched using Docker on a Linux distro.
* You can use any Linux you want, as long as you can install Docker on it.
* OS level requirements are mentioned [here](https://rke.docs.rancher.com/os).
* Prepare Machines/Virtual machines as per the workload requirements.
* In Our reference implementation will use Ubuntu OS.
* Set up [passwordless SSH](../../../docs/ssh.md).
* Create copy of `hosts.ini.sample` as `hosts.ini` and update the IP addresses of all the nodes.
### Opening Ports and disable swap
* Open ports on each of the nodes. Update ``vpc_ip`` variable in ``ports.yaml`` to allow access on the VPC IP.
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ports.yaml
    ```
* Disable swap _(perhaps not needed as swap is already disabled)_.
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini swap.yaml
    ```
* All the cluster nodes should have Intranet as well as Internet connectivity.
### Docker
* Install docker on all nodes.
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini docker.yaml
    ```
## RKE1 cluster setup
* Create a cluster config file. 
    ```
    rke config
    ```
    *  _controlplane, etcd, worker_: At least one of each. For high availability specify _controlplane_, _etc_ on at least two nodes. All nodes may be _worker_.
    * Use default _canal_ networking model.
    * Keep the _Pod Security Policies_ disabled.
    * Sample configuration options:
    ```
    [+] Cluster Level SSH Private Key Path [~/.ssh/id_rsa]:
    [+] Number of Hosts [1]:
    [+] SSH Address of host (1) [none]: <node1-ip>
    [+] SSH Port of host (1) [22]:
    [+] SSH Private Key Path of host (<node1-ip>) [none]:
    [-] You have entered empty SSH key path, trying fetch from SSH key parameter
    [+] SSH Private Key of host (<node1-ip>) [none]:
    [-] You have entered empty SSH key, defaulting to cluster level SSH key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    [+] SSH User of host (<node1-ip>) [ubuntu]:
    [+] Is host (<node1-ip>) a Control Plane host (y/n)? [y]: y
    [+] Is host (<node1-ip>) a Worker host (y/n)? [n]: y
    [+] Is host (<node1-ip>) an etcd host (y/n)? [n]: y
    [+] Override Hostname of host (<node1-ip>) [none]: node2
    [+] Internal IP of host (<node1-ip>) [none]:
    [+] Docker socket path on host (<node1-ip>) [/var/run/docker.sock]:
    [+] Network Plugin Type (flannel, calico, weave, canal) [canal]:
    [+] Authentication Strategy [x509]:
    [+] Authorization Mode (rbac, none) [rbac]:
    [+] Kubernetes Docker image [rancher/hyperkube:v1.17.17-rancher1]:
    [+] Cluster domain [cluster.local]:
    [+] Service Cluster IP Range [10.43.0.0/16]:
    [+] Enable PodSecurityPolicy [n]:
    [+] Cluster Network CIDR [10.42.0.0/16]:
    [+] Cluster DNS Service IP [10.43.0.10]:
    [+] Add addon manifest URLs or YAML files [no]:
    ```
* Check [Recommended Number of Nodes with Each Role for HA and stable cluster](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/checklist-for-production-ready-clusters/recommended-cluster-architecture#recommended-number-of-nodes-with-each-role).
* Remove the default Ingress install by editing `cluster.yaml`:
    ```
    ingress:
      provider: none
    ```
* Bring up the cluster:
    ```
    rke up
    ```
* After successful creation of cluster a `kube_config_cluster.yaml` will get created. Copy the file to `$HOME/.kube` folder.
    ```
    cp kube_config_cluster.yml $HOME/.kube/<cluster_name>_config
    chmod 400 $HOME/.kube/<cluster_name>_config
    ```
* To set this file as global default for `kubectl`, make sure you have a copy of existing `$HOME/.kube/config`. 
    ```
    cp  $HOME/.kube/<cluster_name>_config  $HOME/.kube/config
    ```
* Alternatively, set `KUBECOFIG` env variable:
    ```
    export KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.kube/<cluster_name>_config
    ```
* Test
    ```
    kubect get nodes
    ```
## RKE Cluster tools:
Below contains some of the RKE cluster related operations in brief:
* Adding/Removing nodes to cluster
    _This step is only required if you have to add/delete nodes to an existing cluster._
    * Copy the ssh keys, setup Docker and open ports as given above.
    * Edit the `cluster.yml` file and add extra nodes with their IPs and roles.
    * Run `rke up --update-only` to bring up the changes to the cluster.
* Removing the whole RKE cluster:
    _This step is only required if you knowingly want to delete existing complete cluster and its dependent binaries._
    * From the folder cotaining `cluster.yml`, `cluster-rke.state`, `kube-config-cluster.yml` files created while cluster creation, run the below>
      ```
      rke remove
      ```
    * Remove the cluster components and  binaries from all the nodes using `rke-recovery.sh`
      ```
      cd utils
      ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ../../../utils/rke-components-delete.yaml
      ```
* Recovering the original `cluster.rkestate` file and `cluster.yml` file created during cluster intialisation.
    _This step is only required if you have lost the `cluster.rkestate` and cluster.yaml file for a RKE cluster._
    * Set the kubeconfig file pointing to respective RKE cluster using any of the way mentioneed in cluster creation section above.
    * run the below script to recover the `cluster.yml` and rkestate.yml
    ```
    ../../../utils/rke-recovery.sh
    ```
    * ``cluster.yml`` and `cluster.rkestate` will be created in the same directory, do preserve the same for further use.
* RKE cluster certificate rotation:
    _This step is only required if your cluster certificates are expired and the same needs to be rotated._
    Note: Whenever youâ€™re trying to rotate certificates, the `cluster.yml` that was used to deploy the Kubernetes cluster is required. You can reference a different location for this file by using the --config option. In case you dont have the `cluster.yml` follow above steps to recover it.
    * Follow the [instruction](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/cert-mgmt/#certificate-rotation) to rotate the certificate on need basis.
    __Note:__ Please do check the version info in the provided Rancher docs.
